# Ecommerce Sample Application with .NET 7 by using Microservice Architecture

There are several microservices that have been developed for e-commerce, including modules for Catalog, Basket, Discount, and Ordering. These microservices use both NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Redis, as well as relational databases like PostgreSQL and SQL Server. Communication between the microservices is facilitated through RabbitMQ's event-driven communication, and an Ocelot API Gateway is utilized.


##Implementation

The microservice application is built using a combination of NoSQL and relational databases. MongoDB and Redis are used for storing unstructured data and caching, while PostgreSQL and SqlServer are used for storing structured data.

Communication between microservices is implemented using RabbitMQ for event-driven communication. The Ocelot API Gateway is used to route requests to the appropriate microservices.

The application is built using the principles of Clean Architecture, which emphasizes the separation of concerns in software design. This makes it easy to maintain and modify the application over time.
